        <p>About</p>
        <p>Web development combines my passion for creativity with my interest in technology, and matches my strengths, skills and passions in a way I have never encountered before. I love trying out new ideas and pushing the technology to its limits. Every day always holds a new challenge.</p>
        <p>Throughout my academic and work career, I have had the pleasure of learning new skills and developing others.  I always strive to deliver code that follows best practices and pushes the limits of the technology.  My previous experience in other industries has allowed me to develop soft skills that are transferable such as skills required to be client-facing or communicate with stakeholders outside of the technology field.</p>

        <p>I am always eager to learn more, and to bring my skills and abilities to work each and every day.</p>
